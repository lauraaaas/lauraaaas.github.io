    <h1>COVID-19 and it's impact in New York State</h1>
    <p>As one of the most populated states in the United States, and home to the most populated city in the country, New York state was greatly impacted by COVID-19 during 2020 and 2021.  Following the data provided by NY State in which they keep track of the number of COVID-19 tests administered and the number of positive cases the state had throughout March 2020 to July 2021, we can identify certain patterns on when the pandemic had a greater impact on the people of New York.</p>

<p>During the month the pandemic was declared a national emergency, New York administered around 220,000 COVID-19 test across the state.  Illustrated in Figure 1: Covid-19 tests administered in March 2020, a steady incline in the number of tests administered is seen from the second and third week of March.  On March 22nd, former NY State Governon Andrew Cuomo signed the <a href= "https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-new-york-state-pause-executive-order">New York State On PAUSE </a> executive order, which required all non-essential workers to stay home, along with the Mathilda's Law which established extra protective measures for elderly people and people who were compromised in health.  This line chart presents that March 25th was the day when most COVID-19 tests were administred in the state with a total of 18,651 tests, followed by March 27th and March 30th. </p>

<p> The pandemic continued to impact millions of people throughout 2020 and 2021, New York City being one of the cities most affected in the United States. According to the <a href= "https://www.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/planning-level/nyc-population/census2020/dcp_2020-census-briefing-booklet-1.pdf?r=3"> 2020 Census Results </a> published by NYC government, the city has a population of 8.8 million people.  This means that during certain months, NYC had thousands of positive COVID-19 cases, despite the area being realtively small (in comparison to other major cities) at around 472 square miles. </p> 

<p> As shown in Fig.2: Number of positive COVID-19 cases in NYC in 2021 by month, January 2021 had around 172,000 positive COVID-19 cases.  This is the highest number of COVID-19 cases recorded ever since the pandemic started in 2020, according to the dataset.   This chart also shows that the month with the least amount of positive cases in NYC in 2021 was June with around 6,000 cases reported.  It is important to note that this dataset onyl provides records of the numerical impact of COVID-19 up until July 2021. </p>
